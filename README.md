# 🚀 Custom Token Multichain

## 📌 Overview

Custom Token Multichain is a project that demonstrates the deployment of custom tokens on multiple blockchain networks, including **Ethereum**, **Solana**, and **Tron**. Each blockchain has a different architecture, so the implementation varies accordingly while ensuring compatibility with its respective ecosystem.

This repository provides a structured approach to deploying tokens on different chains, following best practices and leveraging widely adopted standards like **ERC-20 (Ethereum)**, **SPL (Solana)**, and **TRC-20 (Tron)**.

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── eth/       # Token deployment on Ethereum (ERC-20)
├── solana/    # Token deployment on Solana (SPL)
├── tron/      # Token deployment on Tron (TRC-20)
└── README.md  # General project documentation
```

Each folder contains the necessary smart contract code, configuration files, and deployment scripts specific to the blockchain it supports.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Multi-Blockchain Support** – Deploy tokens on Ethereum, Solana, and Tron.  
✅ **Standardized Implementation** – Uses widely accepted token standards (**ERC-20, SPL, TRC-20**).  
✅ **Extensibility** – Designed to support additional blockchain integrations in the future.  
✅ **Decentralized & Secure** – Smart contracts follow best security practices for each blockchain.  
✅ **Easy Deployment** – Pre-configured deployment scripts for each network.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to provide a **scalable and adaptable** token deployment framework that can be extended to other blockchain networks. This can be useful for:

- **DeFi applications** – Custom token issuance for decentralized finance protocols.  
- **NFT Marketplaces** – Utility tokens for NFT ecosystems.  
- **Gaming & Metaverse** – In-game currencies that exist across multiple blockchains.  
- **Cross-Chain Token Interoperability** – Exploring mechanisms for token bridging between chains.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

The project utilizes the following tools and frameworks:

- **Ethereum**: Solidity, Hardhat/Truffle  
- **Solana**: Rust, Anchor framework  
- **Tron**: Solidity, TronBox  

Additional dependencies and requirements can be found inside each chain's respective folder.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To deploy a token on any supported blockchain, navigate to its respective folder and follow the instructions in the provided **README.md** file.

Basic steps include:

1. **Install dependencies** for the respective blockchain.  
2. **Compile smart contracts** to ensure there are no errors.  
3. **Deploy the contract** to a testnet or mainnet.  
4. **Verify and interact** with the deployed token.

Refer to each blockchain's documentation for specific setup and deployment steps.
